COVID 19 Data Analysis using PowerBI

  The steps I followed in the project are :
  
      1. Downloaded COVID19 Dataset from Internet.
      2. Imported Dataset into PowerBI Desktop.
      3. Cleaning Data in Power Query Editor (In this case I only used Continent, Location, Date, Total Cases, New Cases, Total Deaths, and Median Age columns and removed all other columns from Internet and also I used the latest date from the dataset).
      4. Applied visualizations such as Pie Chart, Line Chart and Area Chart to get insights from the data.
      5. In a new page in report view, I created an Instance of the same dataset and again started the process with Cleaning the Data (In this case I only used Location, Date, Total Cases, New Cases and removed all other columns). I have done this step to get the trends of the cases from year 2020 to year 2021.
      6. Finally, created a report by embedding all the visuals into a single page.
      7. Published the report to PowerBI service to share it to the people online.
